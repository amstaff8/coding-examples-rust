# **Rust Coding Examples**

Welcome to my **Rust coding examples repository**. This collection showcases my expertise and practical experience in developing applications using Rust, a powerful system programming language known for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency capabilities.

## **Purpose of this Repository**

This repository serves as a portfolio for potential employers or collaborators to assess my skills in Rust programming. Here, you'll find a range of projects that demonstrate my abilities in:

- **System-level programming**: Leveraging Rust's memory safety without a garbage collector, ideal for systems programming.
- **Concurrency**: Using Rust's ownership system to write safe and efficient multithreaded code.
- **Performance optimization**: Writing highly optimized and performant code, especially for CPU-bound tasks.
- **Error handling**: Implementing robust error handling with Rust's `Result` and `Option` types.
- **Crate integration**: Working with popular Rust crates and developing modular, reusable code.
- **Computer vision**: Experience with **OpenCV** and Rust for implementing image processing, template matching, and real-time vision tasks.
- **Machine learning**: Developing machine learning pipelines and integrating **computer vision** with models such as **YOLO**, **SSD**, and more using both **Rust** and **Python**.

## **Project Overview**

The repository is organized into multiple projects, each showcasing different aspects of Rust development.

## **Getting Started**

To run these projects locally, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine.
